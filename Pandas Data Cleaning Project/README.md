# **Data Cleaning Project using Pandas**

This project involved cleaning a supermarket sales dataset using the Python library Pandas. 
The main objectives of the project were to update data types, remove unwanted and redundant columns, determine and handle null values, remove duplicates, and extract and rename columns as needed.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project was a supermarket sales dataset for the year 2017, obtained as a CSV file named "sales_2017.csv". 
The dataset contained various columns like order_id,product_id,store_id,order_date,price,sales,stock,delivery_date.

## **Data Cleaning Steps :**

#### **The following data cleaning steps were performed on the dataset using Pandas :**

1. Updated Data Types: 

   The data types of the columns were updated to appropriate types using the Pandas "astype()" method. 
   For example, columns containing dates were converted to datetime data type.

2. Removed Unwanted and Redundant Columns: 
   Columns that were not relevant to the analysis or contained redundant information were removed using the Pandas "drop()" method.

3. Determined Null Values: 
   Null values in the dataset were identified using the Pandas "isnull()" method.

4. Removed Null Values: 
   Rows with null values were removed from the dataset using the Pandas "dropna()" method.

5. Filled Null Values with Mean Value: 
   Null values in certain columns were filled with the mean value of the column using the Pandas "fillna()" method.

6. Removed Duplicates: 
   Duplicate rows were removed from the dataset using the Pandas "drop_duplicates()" method.

7. Extracted Column: 
   A column containing the total revenue generated by each sale was extracted from the dataset using the Pandas "apply()" method.

8. Renamed Columns: 
   The names of certain columns were renamed using the Pandas "rename()" method to make them more descriptive and easier to understand.

## **Conclusion :**
By performing these data cleaning steps using Pandas, the supermarket sales dataset was transformed into a more useful and meaningful form for analysis. 
The cleaned dataset could then be used to gain insights and make informed business decisions.
