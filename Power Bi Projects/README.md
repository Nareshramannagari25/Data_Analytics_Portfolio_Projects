# **Pizza Sales Analytics :**

### **Project Overview :** 
   This project focuses on analysing pizza sales data using Power BI. 
   The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that provides insights into pizza sales, customer behaviour, and trends.
   
### **Data Import :** 
   The first step in this project involved importing three datasets using the Get Data - pizzas, pizza types, and orders - into Power BI.

### **Data Cleaning :**
   To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, the data was cleaned using Power Query. 
   The cleaning process included promoting headers, removing duplicates, errors, and blank rows, as well as updating data types.

### **Data Modeling :**
   To create a solid foundation for the analysis, the data was modeled using the fact dimensional model. 
   The orders and pizza types tables were considered as dimensional tables, while the pizzas table was the fact table.

### **Measure Creation :**
   Several measures were created to calculate key metrics, including revenue, total revenue, % contribution, and average order value. 
   Additionally, a calculated column was created for the day name to enhance time-based analysis.

### **Dashboard Creation :**
   To visualize and communicate insights, a dashboard was created using the report view in Power BI.
   The dashboard included the following:
    1. Text boxes
    2. Images
    3. Slicers
    4. Bookmarks to clear slicer filters
    5. Buttons
    6. Cards to display KPIs
    7. Multi-row card
    8. Line chart
    9. Bar chart

### **Conclusion :**
   By leveraging the insights gained from this analysis, the project aims to assist in optimizing the menu, 
   planning promotions and offers, and making informed    decisions to drive sales growth.
