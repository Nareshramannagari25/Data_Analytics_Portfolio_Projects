# **Data Cleaning Project on Sales Data of Stores**

This project is focused on cleaning sales data of stores using SQL queries. 
The dataset used for this project includes sales data from 2017 to 2019 and product details.
The main objective of this project is to clean the data and make it ready for further analysis.

## **Data Cleaning Steps :**

### **1. Data Type Update :**
   In this step, appropriate data types were assigned to the columns in the dataset using SQL queries. 
   Additionally, alternative methods for updating data types were also explored.

### **Removal of Unwanted and Redundant Columns :** 
   Unnecessary columns were removed from the dataset using SQL queries.

### **Identification of Null Values :** 
   Null values were identified in the dataset using SQL queries.

### **Removal of Null Values :** 
   Null values were removed from the dataset using SQL queries.

### **Imputation of Null Values :**
   Null values were imputed with the mean value using SQL queries.

### **Removal of Duplicates :** 
   Duplicate records were removed from the dataset using SQL queries. 
   Alternative methods for removing duplicates were also explored.

### **Column Extraction :** 
   Specific columns were extracted from the dataset using SQL queries.

### **Trimming of Leading and Trailing Spaces :**
   Leading and trailing spaces were removed from the dataset using SQL queries.

### **Column Renaming :** 
   Column names were changed to more appropriate and meaningful names using SQL queries.

## **Conclusion :**
The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis. 
The SQL queries used for each data cleaning step are documented and can be replicated for future cleaning projects.
